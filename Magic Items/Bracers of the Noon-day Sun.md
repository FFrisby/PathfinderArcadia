**Bracers of the Noon-day Sun**

The wearer can cast *Light* at will
2/day can cast *Daylight* as a standard action. 
As a swift action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to channel energy as if they were a cleric with a level equal to their hit dice, but can only use this ability to damage undead, not to heal living creatures.
