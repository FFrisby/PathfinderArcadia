**Hierophants Robe**

If worn by a divine caster, this fine robe allows its wearer to extend the range of a Conjuration (Healing) spell by one step as if using the Reach metamagic feat twice a day. 

Using this ability causes the casting time of a spell to become at least full-round action, even if it would otherwise be shorter.
