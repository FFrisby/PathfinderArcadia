**Raiment of the Eagle**

+2 *Resistance* Bonus to saving throws

Should the capeâ€™s wearer fall more than 5 feet, the cape spreads out behind the wearer and she gently drifts to the ground. This acts exactly like a feather fall spell that only works for the wearer. 

Twice per day, if the wearer grasps the edges of the cape and spreads her arms, she can transform into an eagle (see details below). This effect lasts for 10 minutes but can be ended prematurely as a standard action. 

In addition, while in eagle form, the wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.
When transforming into an eagle, the wearer can expend a mythic point to transform into a Large size eagle instead of a Small one.
Unlike other methods of transforming your shape, you may still speak and cast spells when in eagle form. 

*Note:* When transformed into an animal, your clothes, armour and weapons merge with your body. This means you do not gain any armour or shield bonus from them when in animal form. 

**Small Eagle**: +2 Dex, +1 Natural Armour, 80ft Fly (Average), Low-light vision, +5 Perception
*Space*: 5ft, Reach: 5ft, Size: Small (+1 attack, +1 AC)
*Natural Weapons*: 2x Claws (1d4), 1x Bite (1d4)


**Large Eagle**: +4 Str, -2 Dex, +4 Natural Armour, 80ft Fly (Average), Low-light vision, +5 Perception
*Space*: 10ft, Reach: 5ft, Size: Large (-1 attack, -1 AC)
*Natural Weapons*: 2x Claws (1d8), 1x Bite (1d8)
