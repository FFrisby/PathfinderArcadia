**Rod of Frigid Winds**

This unusual rod feels cold to the touch, and is capped by a shard of unmelting ice. 

It has 6 charges, and replenishes 1 charge per day.

The user can expend charges as a standard action to fire a touch ray of cold energy with a range of 30ft

* 1 charge = 1d3 cold
* 2 charges = 2d4 cold
* 3 charges = 3d6 cold

If the rod ever reaches 0 charges, there is a 10% chance that the rod melts and is destroyed.
