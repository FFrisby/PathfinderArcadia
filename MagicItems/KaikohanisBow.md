**+3 Shocking Composite Longbow [16 Str]**

Once per turn when making a ranged attack, the bowâ€™s wielder may expend a Mythic Point in order make a single attack roll and compare the result against every enemy within 60 feet of her.
The wielder rolls damage only once, and applies it to all foes hit by the attack.
