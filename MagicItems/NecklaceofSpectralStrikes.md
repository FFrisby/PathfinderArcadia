**Necklace of Spectral Strikes**

The amulet grants a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes and provides the benefits of the ghost touch weapon special ability on unarmed strikes. 
As a swift action, the wearer can spend a ki point to make one unarmed strike — whether as a single attack or part of a full attack — an incorporeal touch attack. 
As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to become incorporeal for 1 round.
