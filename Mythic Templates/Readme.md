# Basic Abilities
All Mythic Heroes get the following basic abilities when they gain their first Mythic tier. As your Mythic rank increases, you will unlock additional benefits. 

**Hard to Kill (Ex)**: Whenever you're below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don't die until your total number of negative hit points is equal to or greater than double your Constitution score.

**Mythic Power (Su)**: Mythic characters can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. This power is used by a number of different abilities. Each day, you can expend an amount of mythic power equal to 3 plus double your mythic tier (5/day at 1st tier, 7/day at 2nd, etc.). This amount is your maximum amount of mythic power. If an ability allows you to regain uses of your mythic power, you can never have more than this amount.

**Surge (Su):** You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll. The bonus die gained by using this ability increases to 1d8 at 4th tier, 1d10 at 7th tier, and 1d12 at 10th tier.

**Mythic Feat:** At 1st level you gain a Mythic Feat. Some of these are specific to Mythic abilities, while others are essentially power-ups of normal feats. Normally you would get to pick this yourself, but in order to stop the game becoming completely broken your friendly local GM will instead be picking this on your behalf. Youâ€™re welcome!

**Amazing Initiative (Ex):** Upon reaching the 2nd mythic tier, you gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier. In addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can't be used to cast a spell. You can't gain an extra action in this way more than once per round. 

**Ability Score:** Upon reaching the 2nd mythic tier, an ability score of your choice permanently increases by 2. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th tiers, another ability score of your choice permanently increases by 2; this can be an ability score you've already increased or a different ability score. 

# Path Abilities
Each Mythic Hero must follow a specific Path. This determines what unique powers and abilities are available to you, outside of what you get just for being mythic.

For the purposes of our game, the Path that you gain will be decided by how you attain your Mythic power. In addition, to avoid breaking the game more than anticipated, your Path abilities will be chosen by your GM.
