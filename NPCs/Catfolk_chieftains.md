## The Catfolk Chieftains

There are great three chieftains amongst the catfolk of the great plains:

### Chief Windfire

Brash and boastful, this gregarious catfolk is confident in his own abilities and loudly tells anyone in earshot of just how amazing he is. Considers himself to be the greatest catfolk chieftain, and expects all others to acknowledge that fact.

### Chief Kohanna

The wealthiest chieftain of the catfolk, he rules over the richest hunting grounds but has one of the smaller tribes in terms of numbers. He is always attired in heavy ornaments of gold, and takes offense when other chieftains try and place themselves above him instead of addressing him as an equal.


### Chief Papan

An elderly leader, he is a mystic who spends much of his time communing with his tribes shamans in religious trances, divining the path of his tribe from visions he sees during his seances.
