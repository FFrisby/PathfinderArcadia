## Citali, Twilight Scholar

Citali is a student of the mystic and the occult. She is a devoted (and circumspect) follower of Guetzapoca. She been part of the city's social circles for a long time - she actually died some time ago, but even in death she has maintained her devotion to her god. When she realised she was close to dying, she performed an unusual ritual according to the rites of Guetzapoca. As part of the ritual she died, but her soul remained in control her body. Now she is a kind of intelligent zombie, and wears a somewhat excessive amount of perfume to conceal the embalming fluids she uses to preserve her body.
