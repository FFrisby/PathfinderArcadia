## Illinos, Human Swashbuckler

Leader of a gang of smugglers and thieves, he and his men extract wealth from whoever they can. Illinos sees smuggling as the safest (and most profitable) activity for he and his men to engage in, but he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty if he needs to protect his interests.

After a run-in with the party, he finds himself in a somewhat uncomfortable position. His life was spared, and he has sworn to help them in return if required.
