## Bouda Nightwhisper

Bouda Nightwhisper was a viscious witch who rose to power amongst the gnoll clans, assembling a great warhost over which she ruled with cruelty and cunning.
Despite her position amongst gnoll society, she wasn't actually a gnoll herself - rather, she was a half-elven werehyena who spent most of her time in hybrid form. She was engaged in digging out abandoned ruins within the base of the Great Birt Mesa when the catfolk tribes attacked and broke her warhost (with the assistance of the party). 
She was pursued into the tunnels into the mesa, where the party encountered unholy abberations unearthed by her delving, and eventually confronted and defeated. The party took from her an ancient crown that could command the undead and returned it to is rightful owner - an entombed mummy lord who had been awoken by the Bouda's looting. 

As part of defeating Bouda Nightwhisper, the party encountered a Shadow Demon that she had bound to her service, and which betrayed her location to the party. The party didn't exactly get on that demons good side though, and it fled the encounter swearing vengeance upon them.
