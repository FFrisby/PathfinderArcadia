## Caerelia, Imprisoned Angel

Caerelia was an angel who was sent to the material plane thousands of years ago to assist mortals in their fight against the agents of the Dark Tapestry, those who worship the unknowable beings from beyond the stars.

During a great battle against the agents of a Great Old One, she was defeated and imprisoned within an orb of darkness which sapped her power yet left her conscious. Over time she gained some control over her alien prison, and was able to extend her influence into the spear which had pinned her in place when she was imprisoned, and which could serve as a key.

Eventually the spear (now wielded by Talla) was used to release her from her prison and she set off into the interior of the continent, her intentions unknown.
