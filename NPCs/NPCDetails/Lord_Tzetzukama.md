## Lord Tzetzukama

Lord Tzetuzkama was a wealthy and well-connected nobleman with a large estate outside of the city. He also happened to be the leader of a cult who worshipped the Dark Tapestry, and who sought to bring a being from beyond the stars to Golarion. 

His plot involved killing a lot of people during an astrology party and trying to use an artefact known as the "orb of the void" to power an arcane ritual. The party stopped his plans, and slaughtered the majority of his cult in the process. In the end he was revealed to have been transformed into an otherworldy abomination by the star gods he worshipped, and discarded his human guise during the final battle.
