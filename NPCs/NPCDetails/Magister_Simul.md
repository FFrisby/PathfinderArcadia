## Magister Simul

Magister Simul was a skilled wizard who adventured in his youth. He acquired much knowledge and wealth during his travels, and used this to fund his research and business when he retired from active adventuring. 

He was fascinated by constructs and the possibility of using magically-created tools to increase the quality of life for everyone, to relieve them of drudgery and enable a higher-functioning society. His single-minded pursuit of his goal led him down many esoteric paths, some of which were questionable and ill-advised. In the end, his obsession became his undoing as one of his creations was a sentient demon-infused suit of armour which dominated him into doing its bidding (although it could not force him to break the bindings which held it in the first place)

Simul was slain by the party. Feedback from the destruction of his numerous homonculi weakened him, and his frail constitution meant that once a fight broke out he was quite fragile.
