## Ogguran the Despot
*Despoiler of the Innocent, Maker of Chains, Dominator of the Weak, Master of the Enslaved*

A powerful Kalavakus demon, he sought to elevate himself in the demon hierarchy by exploiting the power of an artificial demi-plane. His plot was foiled by the party, and when his ritual was derailed he lost control of the magics he had unleashed.
