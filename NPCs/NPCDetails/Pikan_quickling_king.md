## Pikan, the Quickling King

Pikan, or as he likes to be called, **King** Pikan (aka the "Blue King"), once lorded over a court of mites in the sewers underneath Tolnalnon. He had once been a member of [Queen Greenheart's](Queen_Elara_Greenheart.md) fey court, but was banished for his cruelty. 

He formed an alliance with the disturbed human he called [Mr. Stink](Tepin_Zuma_BugGuy.md), who bred centipedes which were adored by his Mite servants. He came to the attention of the party when he kidnapped a pixie, but while many of his erstwhile followers were slain resisting the adventurers he surrended and was forced to swear an oath never to do harm to anyone in the party.
