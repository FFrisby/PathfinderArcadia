## Tepin Zuma (aka Mr. Stink or "That crazy bug guy")

Tepin Zuma is technically the heir-apparent of the Zuma clan. 

Unfortunately, he isn't quite the stable and level-headed leader one would hope for. The party encountered him working with a gang of goblins in the slums, raising gigantic centipedes. 

He has an unhealthy obsession with insects of all kinds, and empathises with his insectoid "friends" more with other humans. 

He was returned to his family by the party, where he is being cared for by his aunt.
