## Vaelleus the Apprentice

Once the apprentice of Magister Simul, Vaelleus is an ambititous and ruthless woman, willing to go to almost any length to achieve her goals. She is sweet and agreeable to those who she needs to further her plans, and ruthless to those who she perceives as obstructing her. She formed a pact with a devil at some point in the recent past, but was overpowered by the party and captured. She had been using the lifeforce of living sacrifices to power her experiments, and had hired local criminals to secure her "resources". 

Has been handed over to the city guards to be tried and judged for her crimes.
