## Porcelain Man

A man with skin made of porcelain, but disguised as a normal human, is known to be in the city of Tolnalnon and is seeking the magical disc which Magister Simul was using as a magical focus to create constructs. 

He has visited Citali in his search, and it seems he is seeking it on behalf of an unknown master.
