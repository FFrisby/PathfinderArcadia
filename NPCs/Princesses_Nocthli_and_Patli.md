## Princesses Nochtli & Patli

These twin princesses are now the heads of the **House of Xiu**. Their father was Coyopa, the 5th Prince of the city of Tolnanon, which means they are technically in the line of inheritance for the throne. The lands and wealth of the Xiu clan which they lay claim to are inherited from their mother, who passed away soon after they were born. 

Their father had intended on sacrficing them to mysterious start-gods as part of a cult lead by Lord Tzetzukama, but they were rescued from this fate by the party.

They have given their sponsorship to the party to legitimise them as an adventuring group.

They live in a moderately sized walled complex in the noble district of the city, close to the palace.
