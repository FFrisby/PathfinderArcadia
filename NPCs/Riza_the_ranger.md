## Riza the Ranger

Riza is short, even for a halfling, but she isn't afraid of anyone. She holds a burning grudge against humans for some reason, and takes great delight in bringing down foes larger than herself.

She used to be a partner with Illinos, but after he agreed to help the party in return for his life she went her own way in disgust at his weakness.
