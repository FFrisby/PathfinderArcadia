## Earl Raynos, Taldan Ambassador

Earl Raynos is the leader of a Taldan expedition in Tolnalnon. Officially, his mission is to secure his countries trading interests on the continent of Arcadia - but he arrived with a fleet of five ships, which has made the local rulers nervous, especially as two of those vessels are warships.

He has been granted permission by King Coy'he to establish a trading post on an otherwise uninhabited island just up the coast from the city.
